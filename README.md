#### Snowboarding Extreme Champion

The objective of the game is for the player to reach the bottom of the slope with the fastest time possible. Control your snowboarder with the A and D keys and jump with the Space key. Avoid obstacles that will slow you down. Beat your previous highscore and make it to the top 5 leaderboard. Can be played [here](https://sec.netlify.com/).

#### Feedback

> - index.js: - This file needs more comments, even if some code is self explanatory, outside observers who might want to take part in the open source project need more clarity. 
> - index.js: Good names on functions and variabels and overal clean code!
> - index.js:665 - Add one more line to get an equal number to the number of the beast (wat?)
> - General: Good separating Assets from js files but might need more subcategories to make it more structured like images in images and sound in sound etc.
> - index.html: This file contains alot of Javascript that also need some more sectioning with comments so new developers can navigate better
>- style.css: Same here, needs some general comments to section the code so you know where you are for navigation ease.
>- Overall: clean and consistent code that needs more sectioning and comments!
