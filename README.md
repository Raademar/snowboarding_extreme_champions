The objective of the game is for the player to reach the bottom of the slope with the fastest time possible. Control your snowboarder with the A and D keys and jump with the Space key. Avoid obstacles that will slow you down. Beat your previous highscore and make it to the top 5 leaderboard. Can be played [here](https://sec.netlify.com/).
